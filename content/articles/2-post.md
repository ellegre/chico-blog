description: Without undue modesty - you rarely see such a beautiful dog. At the same time, this is a natural beauty - the ears are in place, the tail too, the coat almost does not require care.

The Ca de Bou is a medium-sized breed with a strong, muscular build. They have a wide chest and an elongated body. Their coat is short, dense, and soft to the touch.They have a large, square-shaped head and powerful jaws.

A very interesting feature is that there is no dog smell. Only if it gets wet in the rain. On the contrary, the ca de bou sometimes smells like cookies or mushrooms. This is amazing and really good for keeping in an apartment.
