The first one is creative sleeping. If there were a world sleeping championship, he would have won a golden medal - he's that good. He works constantly to improve his sleeping skills.
Another sport Chico trains in is speed eating. In the field of sleeping Chico is more on a marathon side, being capable of sleeping for an extraordinary long time. But speed eating is a different matter. He can devour his meal in seconds. In fact we don't know how good he really is, as we don't have enough food to check.

Chico serves an excellent example of a real athlete and a healthy lifestyle.

Be like Chico!
