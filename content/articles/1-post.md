Dogs and ca de bou are no exception sleeping 12-19 hours a day. It's amazing how, with such small loads, ca de bou retain their powerful muscles.

For a person, this is a little offensive - it is worth stopping to play sports for a couple of weeks and the result will not slow down - the physical form is not the same. Chiko walks around all day and at the same time sleeps perfectly all night, but at the same time beautiful muscles roll under the skin and not a single gram of excess weight.
