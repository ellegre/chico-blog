Ca de bou captivates with their willingness to help in the kitchen. As long as the whole family has nothing to do with the fact that you are alone at the stove, this dog will not leave you. 

He'll sit close to the epicenter of the action and watch you spoil great cuts of meat by slicing and frying them instead of just swallowing them. This is the first candidate for a piece of raw potato or carrot. If any food falls on the floor - no problem, the floor will shine clean. Chico will not leave the kitchen until you are done, he will stay with you until the very end of the work.
