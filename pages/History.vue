        <p class="text-p">The Ca de Bou also known as the Perro de Presa Mallorquin is a Molossian type of dog that has an elongated strong and powerful body. This rare breed of medium sized dog noted for having a combative personality originated from the Spanish island of Mallorca, one of the bigger islands that comprise the Balearic archipelago.</p>

        <p class="text-p">The history of this breed extends back to the 11th century. Like any other ancient breeds, the origin of the Ca de Bou is cloudy and has been the subject of controversies. One theory believes that modern day Ca de Bou was recreated from an extinct Spanish breed of dog. It was also speculated that the breed was developed from the remaining specimens of the Mallorquin bulldogs.</p>
        <p class="text-p">Historically, the Perro de Presa Mallorquin resulted from the crossbreeding of different breeds like the Alano Espa√±ol, the Fila de San Miguel with the local fighting dogs that were brought to the Balearics by traders and invaders. During the ancient times, seafaring traders from the east and the west that traded in the Mediterranean regions resulted to the exchange of culture between trading nations. The reciprocal relationship also resulted to the exchange of domestic animals.</p>
        <p class="text-p">Traders and settlers have brought with them large strong dogs with powerful teeth and large heads. These dogs with intimidating appearance were utilized to guard and protect the harbors and the settlements against marauding pirates and robbers coming in by sea.</p>
        <p class="text-p">Among these mostly large, strong and resistants dogs with large heads and powerful teeth, one type distinguished itself and stood out among the rest.  It was the mastiff of the Iberian Peninsula, which, in Spain, was used in various areas as a hunting or as a fighting dog against bulls and other dogs.</p>
        <p class="text-p">This hunting and fighting dogs were brought by the Spaniards when King James 1 of Aragon expelled the Moors from the Balearic Islands in 1232. Some present day breeders believed that the Pyrenean mastiffs, Spanish mastiffs and the old Spanish Alano they are breeding descended from the mastiffs brought by King James 1 to the islands.</p>
